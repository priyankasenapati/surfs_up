**Recommendations for further analysis of business for Surf and Ice Cream Shop:

I would recommend taking into account other weather related data like, hurricane season. Getting the distribution of the visitors by country or place or origination will also help know if they are going to travel in the near future or not. For example, people from a place which had an hurricane are less likely to travel. Including other weather and seasonal changes like sunny and snow forecast, hurricane season, pollen allergy season etc. will also help make the predictions more robust. Also knowing the presence and level of activity of competators will help plan marketing, sales and staffing effort.
